# Forest Classifier

Classifies forests based on the number of trees of a given type (hardwood or conifer) over a certain diameter into standard (exercise 1) or user provided (exercise 2) classes.

Required Packages: <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/">dplyr</a>

Both exercises should be runnable on the trees.csv and classes.csv files as is. Modify the input to the loadForestFile function at the bottom of each script to run with additional data sets and classification systems.
